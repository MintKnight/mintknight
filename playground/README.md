## Setup.
First you need to prepare the environment. Copy .env.example into .env and edit the .env file with the data for your Project and Tokens.

```bash
cd playground
cp .env.example .env
```

Now run the setup. This will create a user in the Sandbox, will set up a company profile, a Global Project for your tokens and a Campaign.

```bash
node setup.js
```
